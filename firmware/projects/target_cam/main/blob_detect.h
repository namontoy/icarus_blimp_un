/*
 * blob_detect - colour-marker detection for a forward-looking camera.
 *
 * Deliberately portable, like optflow_cam's flow_match: this header and its .c
 * file have NO ESP-IDF, no FreeRTOS and no heap use, so the identical code that
 * runs on the camera also compiles on a host with gcc and is tested there
 * against synthetic frames whose answer we chose (see host/test_blob_detect.c).
 *
 * The problem is narrow on purpose. We are looking for ONE object of a known,
 * saturated colour - a balloon, a ball, a painted tag - and we want its position
 * in the image and its apparent size, so the airframe can steer at it and judge
 * the range. The pipeline:
 *
 *   1. Classify every pixel by hue / saturation / value. Hue is what makes a
 *      colour test tolerant of lighting: a red balloon in shadow is darker, not
 *      less red. Saturation and value floors reject the grey walls and dark
 *      corners whose hue is pure noise.
 *   2. Pool pixels into cells (default 2x2). A cell is set only when a majority
 *      of its pixels match, which removes single-pixel speckle for free and
 *      quarters the labelling cost and memory.
 *   3. Label connected cells (4-connectivity, union-find).
 *   4. Report the BLOB_MAX_REPORT largest blobs, largest first, each with a
 *      centroid computed from its matching pixels, so pooling costs no
 *      centroid precision. Several, not one: the IAR-LARC course is four
 *      identical red balloons, and the nearest is not always the next
 *      waypoint, so choosing among them is the navigator's job, not ours.
 *
 * Like flow_match, it fails honestly: no blob above min_area returns found=0,
 * never a guess.
