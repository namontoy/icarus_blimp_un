/*
 * tc_pipeline - the detector as a stack of stages, one entry point.
 *
 *   stage 0   HSV colour test + blobs (blob_detect), always available
 *   stage 1   learned colour table in place of the HSV test        (A)
 *   stage 2   1 + a classifier on each blob's features            (B)
 *   stage 3   2 + a small int8 CNN on crops of the top blobs       (C)
 *
 * Why one function for all of it: the camera calls it, and so does the PC
 * viewer through the same source compiled as a shared library. If the stages
 * were wired together in target_main.c, the viewer would have to repeat that
 * wiring in Python and could quietly disagree with the camera about what a
 * stage does. Here there is only one copy.
 *
 * Fallback is by prefix. A stage needs every model below it, so the stage that
 * actually runs is min(requested, highest N whose models 1..N are all present).
 * A model that failed its checks at load is passed as NULL, so it is simply
 * absent here: no per-frame validation, and no way to run a stage whose model
 * is broken. The effective stage goes out in every CSV row, so a fallback is
 * always visible downstream rather than silent.
 *
 * Portable like blob_detect: no ESP-IDF, no heap. Time comes from a clock the
 * caller passes in (or NULL for no timing).
