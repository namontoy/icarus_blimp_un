/*
 * Forward-looking colour-target detection on an ESP32-CAM.
 *
 * Grabs paced RGB565 frames, finds the largest blob of one configured colour,
 * and streams its bearing, size and (optionally) range as CSV on UART0. Written
 * for the blimp's nose camera: point it at a balloon, ball or painted tag and
 * the flight board gets "target is 6.2 deg right, 1.4 deg up, ~3.1 m away".
 *
 * Built on the same rules as optflow_cam, and sharing its hard-won board
 * handling (boot report before the camera powers up, the GPIO0 reflash window,
 * flash LED driven low, radios never started):
 *
 *  1. HEAT. QQVGA, paced frames, no WiFi. The idle time is the point. The
 *     sensor sets the pace: at XCLK 20 MHz it makes a frame every 79.968 ms
 *     (12.5 FPS), the loop takes each one as it completes, and nothing faster
 *     exists. 'f' can only choose every n-th frame.
 *
 *  2. HONEST FAILURE. ok=0 means NO TARGET, never "target dead ahead". A blob
 *     touching the frame edge is flagged clipped and gets no range, because
 *     its apparent size is an underestimate. The runner-up blob's size is
 *     printed so an ambiguous scene - two red things - is visible downstream.
 *
 *  3. COLOUR IS NOT FREE. Hue survives shadow far better than RGB does, but
 *     auto white balance actively works against a detector when the target
 *     fills much of the frame: it shifts the whole image to make that colour
 *     greyer. AWB is left on by default and can be frozen with 'w0' once the
 *     scene is lit; which is better on this airframe is a measurement, not a
 *     calculation.
