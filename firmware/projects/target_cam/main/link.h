/*
 * link - raw camera frames and baud-rate changes on UART0, for the PC viewer.
 *
 * The flight output of this firmware is the CSV stream at 115200 baud: that is
 * what the ESP32-S3 will read. Everything here is bench-only. It lets the PC
 * see the exact pixels the detector sees, which is the only way to calibrate
 * colour honestly, and is off unless the viewer asks for it.
 *
 * A frame on the wire:
 *
 *   #!FRAME seq=<n> t_ms=<ms> w=160 h=120 fmt=rgb565be len=38400 crc=<hex8>\r\n
 *   <len raw bytes, exactly as the sensor delivered them>
 *   \r\n#!END seq=<n>\r\n
 *
 * followed by the ordinary CSV row for the same capture (same t_ms), so the PC
 * can draw the camera's own detection on the frame. crc is standard CRC-32
 * (zlib.crc32). A log line from another task can land inside the payload; the
 * CRC exposes it and the PC drops that frame and resynchronises on the next
 * "#!FRAME" header.
 *
 * Sending a frame blocks the main loop for len*10/baud seconds - 3.3 s at
 * 115200, 0.42 s at 921600 - so while frames are being sent, dt_ms and FPS do
 * not represent flight. The viewer says so.
