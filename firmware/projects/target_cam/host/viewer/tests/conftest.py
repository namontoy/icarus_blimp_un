# windows still alive. Qt then deleted those windows from C++, and sip never
# learned that their C++-made children - pyqtgraph's sub-menus, viewports,
# status bars - had died with them. Their wrappers stayed in sip's address
# map, where QWidget is also listed at +16 (its QPaintDevice part), so a later
# object allocated at that address came back as a dead wrapper pointing 16
# bytes too low: the intermittent segfault in pyqtgraph's menu set-up. The
# viewer itself makes one QApplication and keeps it until exit.
